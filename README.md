# 🐍 Python Trivia Game (Streamlit)

An interactive **Python quiz application** built using **Streamlit** that tests users’ knowledge of Python programming fundamentals.

The game randomly selects questions, evaluates answers in real time, and tracks the user's score across multiple questions using session state.

This project demonstrates how Python can be used to build lightweight interactive web applications for education and learning.

# 🚀 Project Overview

Learning programming becomes more engaging when combined with interactive tools.  
This application provides a simple and fun way to test Python knowledge through a trivia-style quiz.

The app randomly selects questions from a predefined set and guides the user through a short quiz session.

At the end of the game, users receive their final score and can restart the game.

# ✨ Features

### Interactive Quiz Interface
A clean and simple interface built with Streamlit for answering questions.

### Random Question Selection
Each game randomly selects **5 questions** from a larger question pool.

### Real-Time Answer Validation
The system checks user answers instantly and provides feedback.

### Score Tracking
The application keeps track of the player's score throughout the quiz.

### Session State Management
Uses Streamlit’s `session_state` to maintain game progress without resetting.

### Restart Option
Players can restart the quiz after completing the game.
